# ISTD-Rep-Purposals
This is for the ISTD benefit that I create this repository. I will implement them when new proposals come in. Or I just give the link for you guys to add on. Let's make ISTD more enjoyable and democratic.

//Hello, this is from Wentao. Recently I want to run for the ISTD rep so I really your help.
//This is the collected ideas from our ISTD people.
//I create this file so that we could share our ideas about ISTD so that the rep can make proposals from it and try to get approval from SUTD.
//This is not for my good. If I did get the rep, I would pass this repository to the new rep.
//So no worry that your ideas cannot be seen to the committee.
//It would help me and the school more if you leave your id number or name beside your proposal, because if the school wants to do it, they can develop the idea with you.
//Anyone invited could just add on ideas, but please don't modify or erase others' ideas. Please...( >﹏<。)
