1. Can the school record our lectures, turn it into something like web lectures? 
	So when I miss some part of the class. I can go back to watch the video instead of asking the prof again.
	//need to ger permission from school because of the copyright issues and need to buy recorder haha
2. Can the school raise the 1d/2d project budget? The budget is quite low for some materials.
