//Hello, this is from Wentao. Recently I want to run for the ISTD rep so I really ur help.
//This is the collected ideas from our ISTD people.
//I create this file so that we could share our ideas about ISTD so that the rep can make perposals from it and try to get approval from SUTD.
//This is not for my own good. If I did got the rep, I would pass this repository to the new rep.
//So no worry that your ideas cannot be seen to the comittee.
//It would help me and the school more if u leave your id number or name beside your purposal, coz if the school want to do it, they can develop the idea with u.
//Anyone invited could just add on ideas, but please don't modify or erase others' ideas. Please...( >﹏<。)
